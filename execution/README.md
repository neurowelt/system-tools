## Testing

You can find example scripts to test the functionality of the execution projects in the [`testing`](./testing/) directory.

If you run into permission problems for any of the bash testing scripts, simply run:

```bash
chmod a=rwx path/to/script.sh
```

This commend provides read, write and execute permissions for that file.
